# LTI Keys Directory

This directory contains the RSA keys used for LTI 1.3 authentication.

**Files (generated by `generate-keys.sh`):**
- `private.pem` - Private key used by BYTEGrader to sign tokens
- `public.pem` - Public key registered with Moodle for verification

**Generate keys:**
```bash
./docker/scripts/generate-keys.sh
```

**Security:**
- Never commit `private.pem` to version control
- The `.gitignore` excludes these files automatically
- Keep backups of your keys for disaster recovery
